# Google-Trends-Analyzing-with-R
It`s how to compare popularity of google requests in specific regions and ploting this dependence on region`s map
This is one of my practical works. When i was doing this task, i didn`t find this method of analysis google trends with R in the internet
So i decided to share my script 
I compared requests for two football teams FC Barcelona and Real Madrid in Ukraine to show which team is more popular in my country in each region
You can compare anything what you want.To ploting ratios between your requests you need to download "geoMap.csv" on Google Trends of your requests
Opposite the map of your requests in Google Trends will be a button for downloading whis file.
Then you need to change your downloaded file ("geoMap.csv") with deleting first 3 rows and creating 1st row like in my file (with names of coloumns)
After that create new file on base your "geoMap.csv" (i called this file "ukrna.csv")
Good luck! :)
